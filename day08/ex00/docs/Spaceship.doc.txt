<------------------------------------------ Spaceship

An abstract that defines the base minimum for the game's spaceships.
The Spaceship is awaiting an array with name, x-position, y-position
and img_url.

All ships will need their position and name as public variables which
can be changed and easily accessed. Ships also have img_url and bullet_size
as private variables which are shared by the abstract class and by themselves
and which are read-only. They have a private error variable which is used only
by the abstract class.

Public functions:
get_img() -> Read-only the url of the image of this ship.

Required functions for all children:
shoot(); -> extended classes will have their own methods of shooting.
__toString() -> extended class will have their own methods returning a string
